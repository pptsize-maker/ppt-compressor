# About Me · Creator of PPTSize

Hi everyone — I’m the developer behind **PPTSize**, an independent project focused on **high-quality PowerPoint compression** — or in other words, **PPT compression / compress PPT / PPT compressor**.

Most tools either make your presentation *small but blurry*, or *clear but huge*.  
PPTSize aims to solve that — **compress PPT files without losing quality**.

## 🧠 Core Philosophy

Compression isn’t just about reducing file size — it’s about **understanding images, audio, and video data** and optimizing them smartly.

Here’s what powers PPTSize:

- Adaptive compression for different image formats (JPEG / PNG / GIF / BMP)  
- Intelligent scaling that preserves transparency (auto-resizes if width or height >1920)  
- Perceptual color difference (Redmean algorithm)  
- Smart audio/video transcoding for size-quality balance  
- Final repacking with **Zopfli** and **Deflate64** for maximum gain  

This makes the final PowerPoint file both **sharp and small** — true **ppt compression** without compromise.
